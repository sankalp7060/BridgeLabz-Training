Despite feeling puny after the long hike, Jane’s magnanimous spirit turned a minor setback into something hunky dory, 
making even the most sacrosanct rules feel flexible. 
Her attempt at saying supercalifragilisticexpialidocious perfectly ended in laughter, a gentle prune of her nerves, 
while dismissing the mishap with floccinaucinihilipilification. 
In the end, the day was unforgettable, a chaotic yet joyful mix of wonder and whimsy.
